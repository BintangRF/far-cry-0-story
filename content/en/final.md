# **Arc 3 ‚Äì Final Battle: Adrik & Aldric Ruviero**

---

## üé≠ Overview

After accidentally stepping into Valdoro‚Äôs dark underbelly, Alex has already dismantled the smaller pillars supporting the Ruviero empire.
Yet the city is far from free‚Äîbecause at the top still stand **Aldric and Adrik**, two brothers who built Valdoro with **a facade of prosperity above and blood beneath**.

- **Aldric** (The Brain): the mastermind, the public face maintaining the city‚Äôs illusion of prosperity.
- **Adrik** (The Fist): street enforcer, the iron hand ensuring everyone obeys through fear.

Here, the player faces the core question:
Does killing them truly free the city, or merely open the door to even greater chaos?

## ‚öîÔ∏è Main Battle

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Adrik "The Fist"**

- As Alex breaches the HQ, **Adrik immediately intervenes**.
- Weapons: **heavy machine gun, grenades, and light exoskeleton** to augment his physical strength.

**Gameplay Vibe**:

- Chaotic, explosions everywhere, gunfire, screams.
- Player is forced to confront brutal close-quarters combat.
- Adrik taunts Alex continuously: _‚ÄúYou think you can take us down alone? I am this city!‚Äù_

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Aldric "The Brain"**

- After Adrik‚Äôs defeat, **Aldric awaits in the glass throne room**.
- He doesn‚Äôt attack immediately, instead attempting to **test Alex‚Äôs resolve**.

**Initial Encounter**:

- Aldric claps slowly, smiling coldly.

- ‚ÄúLook outside the window. Fire, riots, and blood. That‚Äôs all your doing. We‚Äôve kept this city safe. You‚Ä¶ have only unleashed the wild beasts.‚Äù

- If Alex refuses Aldric‚Äôs peace offer, the battle begins.

**Battle**:

- Arena filled with technological traps: **automated turrets, armed drones, steel doors that trap the player**.
- Aldric is not a brutal fighter but cunning: weakening Alex with tactics before confronting directly using modern weaponry (automatic pistols, hidden knives, even electric devices).

**Aldric‚Äôs Death Dialogue**:

> _‚ÄúCongratulations‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre free now. Free to watch this city burn, with no one left to control its flames.‚Äù_
