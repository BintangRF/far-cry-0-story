# **Path: Corrupt Old Government Faction**

---

## 🎭 Overview

This faction consists of former officials, generals, intelligence agents, and old cronies who lost power when the Twin Mafia took the city. They call themselves **“saviors of the city”**, aiming to restore law and order. But the law they mean is just **old corruption**: full of bribery, nepotism, and exploitation of citizens for their own gain.

They use the player as a tool to destroy the Twins’ loyalists. Yet the deeper the cooperation, the clearer it becomes that **they are just as rotten**, only wearing a different face.

## 🔪 Mini Boss Flow

---

### 1. **Brawler Mini Boss – “The Iron Matron”**

## ⚖️ Consequences After Mini Bosses

- Citizens begin to whisper, wondering if the player is truly a liberator… or a tool of returning old rulers.
