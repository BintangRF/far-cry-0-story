# **Path: The Old Corrupt Government Faction**

---

## 🎭 Overview

This faction consists of former officials, generals, intelligence officers, and old crony businessmen who lost their power when the Mafia Twins seized the city.

They call themselves the **“saviors of the city”**, but what they really mean is the **return of old corruption**: bribery, nepotism, and total control of the people for the benefit of a few.

They don’t see Alex as a hero, but as a **covert operative tool** to destroy the Twins’ loyalists.
However, the longer Alex works with them, the clearer it becomes that they are **just as rotten**, only wearing different uniforms.

# ⚖️ Final Choice – Old Government Path

After the three loyalists fall, the faction reveals its true ambition:
They want to **reclaim Valdoro under the old face of corruption**.

The player is given three options:

---

### 1. **Stay with Them**

- Alex officially becomes a “state asset.”
- The city is stable on the surface, the mafia cornered, but old corruption returns to power.
- **Ending:**
  Alex sits in a secret meeting room with generals and officials. A city map covered in red markers. They say:
  _“This city is ours again… and yours too.”_

---

### 2. **Walk Away (Neutral)**

- Alex refuses to be their puppet.
- The Old Government doesn’t kill him, but spreads **smear propaganda** about him.
- The city falls into their hands, the people fooled by false images.
- **Ending:**
  Alex walks alone through the ruined city streets.
  A giant billboard: **“The City is Safe in the Right Hands”**, smiling faces of old officials.

---

### 3. **Destroy Them**

- Alex storms their headquarters (old government building / former military base).
- Old corruption collapses, their apparatus disbands, but the city falls into anarchy.
- **Ending:**
  Government building burns. Citizens gather: some cheer, some tremble in fear.
  Camera close-up on Alex’s face → “hero or destroyer”?
