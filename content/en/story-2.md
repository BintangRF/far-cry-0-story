# **Path: Corrupt Old Government Faction**

---

## 🎭 Overview

This faction consists of former officials, generals, intelligence officers, and old cronies who lost power when the Twin Mafia seized the city. They call themselves **“the city’s saviors”**, claiming to restore law and order.

They use the player as a tool to eliminate the Twins’ loyalists. But the deeper Alex works with them, the clearer it becomes that **they are just as rotten**, only wearing a different face.
