# **Rival Mafia Path**

---

### 🎭 Overview

The **Rival Mafia** are an old gang that once ruled Valdoro before being crushed by the **Ruviero Twins**.
Now they lie in hiding, waiting for the chance to reclaim the city.

To them, Alex’s arrival is an **unexpected gift**: a stranger capable of hurting the Twins—something they never managed themselves.

But joining them means stepping into a world of **dirty politics, mafia intrigue, and bloody turf wars.**
They don’t care about Valdoro’s freedom, only about becoming its **new kings.**

The Rival Mafia do **not grant power directly**, but instead provide **tactical tools and intel.**
This makes fights against the Twins’ loyalists more varied:

- Player may **accept mafia support** → fights become easier, but Alex looks more like their pawn.
- Or **reject their help** → fights are harder, but Alex maintains his independence.
