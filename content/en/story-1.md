# **Rival Mafia Path**

---

### üé≠ Overview

The **Rival Mafia Group** is an old gang that once ruled Valdoro before being overthrown by the **Ruviero Twins**. They lost power, forced to hide in the city‚Äôs shadows, and have been waiting for a chance to rise again.

For them, Alex‚Äôs appearance is an **unexpected gift**: a stranger capable of hurting the Twins, something they themselves could never do.

They are cunning, bloodthirsty, and care about only one thing: **absolute power**. Joining them means entering a world of mafia political intrigue, betrayal, territorial battles, and ruthless tactics.

## Mini Boss 2 ‚Äì **Lucia "The Iron Widow"** (Brawler)

- **Character**  
  Lucia is a brutal woman who was once a street fighter. She lost her husband to mafia gambling and was forced to work for them to survive. Her body bears old scars, and she wields a specially crafted iron mace, almost impossible for a normal person to lift.  
  Lucia symbolizes the raw strength of the Ruviero family‚Äîassigned as a **human barrier** guarding their illegal fight operations.

- **Location**  
  Secret training warehouse on the outskirts of the city, where people are forced to fight to the death for entertainment and underground betting. The audience consists of thugs, bookies, and high-paying elites.

- **Fight**  
  A blood-soaked arena full of cheers. Lucia doesn‚Äôt fight alone‚Äîthe paying audience attacks Alex from the sidelines, throwing bottles, chairs, and sometimes joining the fight. Lucia herself is brutal, attacking with **pure rage**, each strike capable of breaking bones.

- **Last Words**

  > _"I fight‚Ä¶ to survive‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre just a pawn‚Ä¶ like me‚Ä¶ but a pawn like me can choose to die with a clenched fist."_

- **After Defeat**  
  The Rival Mafia praises Alex, calling it a major first step in **destroying the Twins‚Äô loyalists**. They grow more confident that Alex is their tool to reclaim the city.

## Mini Boss 3 ‚Äì **Elena "The Black Veil"** (Spy)

- **Character**  
  Elena is a woman full of deceit. She was once a government informant but betrayed and sold information to the Twins. She is intelligent, slippery, and always **three steps ahead** of her enemies. Elena is the mastermind behind many mafia operations executed cleanly and without a trace.

- **Location**  
  Luxury casino in the city center‚Äîfilled with neon lights, mirrors, and heavy surveillance. Behind the glamour, the casino serves as a hub for espionage networks and blackmail operations.

- **Fight**  
  A strategy-focused battle. Elena is not a physical fighter but controls **traps**, surveillance cameras, and minions disguised as casino patrons. She even disguises herself to confuse Alex, forcing him to distinguish real enemies from decoys.

- **Last Words**

  > _"Heh‚Ä¶ information is the most valuable currency. I know everything‚Ä¶ including who you really are. Too bad‚Ä¶ now that secret dies with me."_

- **After Defeat**  
  The Rival Mafia warns Alex coldly:  
  _‚ÄúIf Elena could know all your secrets, others could too. Never trust anyone‚Äîeven us.‚Äù_  
  A subtle warning that they might betray Alex one day.

## Mini Boss 4 ‚Äì **Viktor "The Hound"** (Executioner)

- **Character**  
  Viktor is the legendary executioner of the Ruviero family, known for hunting his targets to the ends of the earth. Nicknamed **‚ÄúThe Hound‚Äù**, his killing instinct is like a hunting dog: once he smells blood, he won‚Äôt stop until the target is dead.  
  He was once an executioner for the old government before being sold to the mafia.

- **Location**  
  Secret underground prison turned execution chamber. Narrow corridors filled with corpses and torture devices: electric chairs, gas rooms, heated irons.

- **Fight**  
  A claustrophobic, tight arena. Viktor wields a massive axe capable of breaking Alex‚Äôs defenses in a single blow. He also uses prison traps to corner Alex, making the fight extremely tense.

- **Last Words**

  > _"You think destroying me‚Ä¶ means the end of everything? Heh‚Ä¶ the Twins have already prepared hell for you‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll be waiting there."_

- **After Defeat**  
  The Rival Mafia cheers, claiming the path toward the Twins is now wide open. Yet behind their excitement, their true faces show: **they don‚Äôt want the city‚Äôs freedom, only to replace the Ruviero family.**
