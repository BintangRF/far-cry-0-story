# **Rival Mafia Path**

---

### üé≠ Overview

The **Rival Mafia** is an old gang that once ruled Valdoro before being defeated by the **Ruviero Twins**. They lost their power, forced to hide in the shadows of the city, waiting for a chance to rise again.

For them, Alex‚Äôs arrival is an **unexpected blessing**: a stranger capable of injuring the Twins, something they themselves could not do.

They are cunning, bloodthirsty, and care about only one thing: **absolute power**. Joining them means entering a world full of political intrigue, betrayal, territory wars, and dirty tactics.
