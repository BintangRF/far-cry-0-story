## Life Story

Alex, a twenty-seven-year-old man, sounds too young to be called a retiree. Yet he hung up his military uniform far earlier than most of his peers.

From adolescence, he was already familiar with conflict. Losing his family to political turmoil left him with a void—and the military became the only place that gave him direction. By eighteen, Alex officially joined the Marines.

Years on the frontlines taught him the meaning of courage, loss, and the absurdity of victory. He watched comrades fall one by one, while medals felt like cold metal weighing on his neck. To him, every honor was a bitter reminder that war leaves only sorrow.

By his mid-twenties, Alex began questioning the purpose of it all. When no answer came, he chose to step away. He applied for early retirement—a shock to many, but for him, the only way to preserve his sanity.

Alex moved to a city known for its beauty and tranquility, attempting to build a new life. His days were filled with simple routines, as if seeking redemption through peace. But that serenity was short-lived.

He gradually realized that the city’s calm was not born of harmony, but manipulation. Its leaders maintained “peace” with dirty hands—sacrificing the voiceless to preserve the city’s pristine image.

His military instincts stirred once more. Alex knew he could close his eyes and let it all pass—but his conscience refused. He had been a witness to injustice long enough. This time, even alone, he chose to fight.

Alex’s war is far from over. Yet his battlefield is no longer the frontlines; his enemies are the dark shadows lurking behind the city’s peaceful facade.
