## Life Story

Among the Ruviero family, known for their toughness and boldness, Elena carved her own path: **a sharp mind with an insatiable thirst for knowledge**. From a young age, she displayed intelligence beyond her peers. Books were her weapons, logic her shield, and the academic world her stage. By twenty-nine, she had become one of the most respected lecturers at Valdoro University.

Yet Elena’s intellect could not remain confined to lecture halls. The Ruviero twins recognized the danger of a mind capable of analyzing, planning, and predicting. She was entrusted with a vital role: **the eyes and ears of the family**.

Behind the scenes, Elena is **“The Black Veil”**, a shadow unseen in the field yet present in every operation. She plants informants everywhere—government, police, business, even media. Every move of enemies, every step of traitors, even the private secrets of city officials… all could reach her ears.

Her work ensures that the Ruviero family’s criminal enterprises remain untouchable. Police never find evidence, political rivals always lag behind, and rival factions are perpetually a step too late. All thanks to Elena, the unseen strategist.

In public, she maintains the persona of an **elegant, authoritative lecturer**. Students see her as a role model, colleagues admire her, and the public recognizes her as a Ruviero relative who chose education over politics. No one suspects that the delicate hands writing on the blackboard are also pulling the strings of underground power.

Elena believes in one thing: **weapons can kill a person, but information can destroy entire kingdoms**. And that is the weapon she wields to safeguard the Ruviero legacy.
