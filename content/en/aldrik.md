## Life Story

Aldric Ruviero is **the architect of the Ruviero family’s dominance**. Through clever strategy and political acumen, he ensures that the people of Valdoro see the family as a pillar of strength, protection, and prosperity. He is the one who convinces citizens that the family’s youthful political victories are not luck, but the result of foresight and relentless effort.

On the political stage, Aldric presents himself as a consummate bureaucrat. He knows how to manage the parliament, pacify political rivals, and ensure every civic interest ultimately serves his family’s advantage. Every public policy he promotes carries hidden layers that tighten the Ruviero grip on Valdoro.

Behind his diplomatic and approachable facade, Aldric is **the shadow king of the criminal world**. He oversees smuggling operations, illicit trade, and international mafia networks with an iron fist. His role is not that of the executioner, but the orchestrator: he gives the orders, lays out the grand plan, and lets his siblings and relatives execute their parts.

With Elena’s intelligence-gathering as the spy and Adrik’s precision as the enforcer, Aldric constructs a flawless power structure—where politics and crime are not separate realms, but two sides of the same coin.

For Aldric, **true power is total control**. Control over the people, control over enemies, control over family, control over Valdoro. He never hesitates, never falters, and never allows room for weakness.

To the public, he is a charismatic leader bringing stability and progress.
To the underworld, he is the undisputed mastermind—a king without a crown who can never be overthrown.
