## Life Story

On the streets of Valdoro, Diego was just a child without direction—no family, no name, no future. Everything changed when the Ruviero twins found him. They saw potential in him, offering not just food or shelter, but something far greater: a name and honor.

From that moment, Diego was no longer a street kid. He became **Diego Ruviero**, the adopted sibling of the city’s most powerful family. And like every member of that family, he learned to wear two faces.

In public, Diego is a model teenager. He attends charity events, helps fund schools, distributes food to the poor, and is seen as a calming symbol of hope for the citizens of Valdoro. People view him as a golden child, the embodiment of goodness and a bright future.

But when night falls, Diego’s true face emerges. Trained directly by one of the Ruviero twins, he becomes a near-perfect young assassin. His skills include sniping, throwing knives, and reconnaissance. Every step is swift, every strike precise, and every mission ends in blood.

Diego never questions his path. He fully believes in the Ruviero family’s teachings: love is a way to embrace, fear is a way to control. To him, the two are not contradictions—they are two sides of the same coin.

By the age of seventeen, Diego has become more than an adopted child. He is the symbol of Ruviero power: young, talented, beloved by the people, and feared by enemies alike.
