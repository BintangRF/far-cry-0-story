## Life Story

From a young age, Lucia grew up in the shadow of the powerful Ruviero name. Unlike her relatives, who were immersed in politics, she chose a different path. Lucia opened a **small bakery in Valdoro’s old district**, cultivating an image of simplicity: a young woman rising before sunrise, rolling up her sleeves, and serving warm bread to anyone who came by.

To the public, Lucia represents the kindness of the Ruviero family that touches daily life. She rarely appears on the political stage, yet everyone knows, respects, and even loves her. Her smile becomes a bridge that soothes the gap between rulers and ordinary citizens.

However, beneath her gentleness flows the strong bloodline of the Ruvieros. From her teenage years, the Ruviero twins ensured that Lucia would not grow up as just a sweet symbol. She was trained in combat, forged in discipline, and immersed in the underground world filled with danger. From this came her nickname, **“The Iron Widow”**—a woman capable of taking down opponents twice her size with raw strength and unwavering resolve.

Lucia does not seek trouble, but when the family’s honor is at stake, she intervenes without hesitation. The Ruviero family’s enemies quickly learn that behind the bakery girl’s friendly smile lies a **steel hand that can crush bone**.

She lives dual roles without contradiction: by day, a cheerful bakery owner; by night, the family’s shield and sword. For Lucia, both are simply different ways of showing the same thing—**absolute loyalty to the blood and name of the Ruvieros**.
