## Life Story

To the people of Valdoro, Viktor appears as a simple thirty-five-year-old man managing a **small inn for tourists**. The building is modest, his service warm, and his smile genuine. He greets every guest as if they were family, ensuring they feel comfortable in the peaceful city. Children often play in the inn’s yard, and Viktor always finds time to joke or hand out candy.

No one would suspect that this kind-hearted man is part of the powerful Ruviero family. His name is kept hidden, he never appears at public events, and his life seems too ordinary to be connected with politics or organized crime.

Yet beneath the inn lies a **dark secret**: a basement designed for torture. Here, Viktor reveals his true nature as **“The Hound”**, the family’s executioner. The name comes from his predatory instincts—once he targets someone, he will hunt relentlessly until they surrender or die.

Traitors, business enemies, or anyone who disturbs the peace of the city—all end up in the dark basement. No one leaves intact, and no one ever returns to tell the tale. Viktor ensures one thing: **no threat can escape the Ruviero grip**.

He lives two contrasting lives without hesitation. Above ground, he is a friendly guardian of peace. Below ground, he is a monster protecting his family with blood and pain.

For Viktor, both exist as expressions of his absolute belief: **keeping Valdoro safe, no matter the cost.**
