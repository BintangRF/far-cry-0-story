# **Arc 1 – The First Shadow**

---

## **Arc Beginning – Fighting Alone**

After infiltrating Valdoro under a disguised identity, Alex starts moving on his own.  
He has no organization, no major resources, but he has the determination to fight.

His first targets are **small mafia businesses**—the lifelines of their power on the streets:

- **Smuggling warehouse at the port** – where they supply weapons and drugs.
- **Dark nightclub** – a hub for money laundering and a drug distribution den.
- **Illegal gambling house** – the underground economy’s heart of the Ruviero family.

Early gameplay emphasizes a **hit-and-run style**: Alex strikes fast, destroys, then vanishes before reinforcements arrive.

Each small attack spreads the name of the “shadow figure” among the mafia.  
They grow uneasy, aware someone dares to challenge them.

### **Alex’s Monologue**

> _“I don’t have an army. No heavy weapons. All I have is one thing: the truth that they can be hurt. And once their blood spills, the scent will spread across the city.”_

---

## **Encounter with Mini Boss 1 – “The Prodigy”**

The Ruviero mafia doesn’t stay idle.  
They send **Diego Ruviero**, the golden child of the mafia family, 17 years old. Diego is a **talented young assassin**: expert sniper, skilled with throwing knives, and a ruthless stalker. Despite his youth, he is known as a **family pride symbol**. Citizens see him as a child prodigy supporting social foundations—though he is a killing machine raised by the mafia.

### **Unique Gameplay: Diego as the Hunter**

- Diego doesn’t appear immediately in cutscenes.
- He **hunts Alex across missions**, shooting from afar, leaving traps, and disappearing.
- Eventually, a major duel occurs on **Valdoro’s skyscraper rooftops at night**.

---

### **Boss Fight – Diego "The Prodigy"**

- **Arena**: Rooftop with neon billboards, blinking city lights, and heavy rain.
- **Fighting Style**: Stealthy, fast, unpredictable. Diego can hide, strike from darkness, then escape.
- **Atmosphere**: Tense music, rain sounds, and faint cheers from unaware citizens below witnessing a deadly duel.

---

### **Diego’s Last Words**

When Alex finally defeats Diego:

> _“Do you think I wanted this? I’m just a street kid… they gave me a home, a name, and weapons. If I die now… who will care?”_

Diego dies as a symbol of how the mafia corrupts the youth, nurturing loyalty with false affection.

## **After Mini Boss 1’s Death – The City Begins to Wobble**

- **Valdoro’s underground media** reports the incident framing the mafia: _“Mysterious hitman attacks the Ruviero family.”_
- The public panics: Diego is known as a prodigy and symbol of hope. They do not know his true face.
- **The mafia is furious**, increasing street patrols, tightening business security, and issuing the order: _“Find our child’s killer. Dead or alive.”_

The city begins to change—Alex officially becomes the **number one enemy of the mafia family**.

---

## **Emergence of Other Factions**

With the fall of the mafia’s “golden child,” the **balance of power shakes**.  
Other factions begin to appear, offering to help Alex:

---

### 1. **Rival Mafia Group**

- **Identity**: An old gang that once ruled before being overthrown by the Ruviero family.
- **Characteristics**: Brutal, opportunistic, power-hungry.
- **Promise**: Weapons, money, and street forces.
- **Danger**: Joining them means swapping one mafia ruler for another.

---

### 2. **Shadow of the Corrupt Old Government**

- **Identity**: Politicians, former police, and old officials who lost power.
- **Characteristics**: Cunning, bureaucratic, full of political intrigue.
- **Promise**: Political connections, secret documents, access to government facilities.
- **Danger**: Helping them opens the door for the same rotten old regime.

---

### 3. **Idealist Group (Anti-Mafia)**

- **Identity**: A small group of civilians, academics, and former activists.
- **Characteristics**: Weak militarily but strongly idealistic.
- **Promise**: Information from citizens, secret distribution channels, moral support.
- **Danger**: Lacking real power, vulnerable to mafia attacks without protection.

## **Cliffhanger – End of Arc 1**

**Cutscene**:  
Alex sits in a dimly lit bar, his body battered after the duel with Diego.  
Three representatives enter one by one, sitting across from him, each speaking:

- _“This city needs someone like you. Let’s take back what’s rightfully ours.”_ (Rival Mafia)
- _“Alone you won’t survive. With us, you can cleanse the city… the right way.”_ (Corrupt Government)
- _“If you truly want freedom… listen to the voice of the people. We may be small, but we are the only honest ones.”_ (Idealists)

The camera focuses on Alex’s face—he remains silent.  
Players are now given the choice of **which faction to ally with first**.
