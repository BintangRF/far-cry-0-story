## 🎬 Prologue – The Shadow of Valdoro

### Flashback – The Ruviero Family’s Victory

**Setting:** Valdoro, one year ago. Election night of triumph.
_The town hall is filled with banners reading “Ruviero for the Future.” Fireworks light up the sky, the crowd cheers, victory music echoes._

On stage, **Aldric and Adrik Ruviero** stand as the new generation of Valdoro. At the side of the stage, a young **Diego**, still in his early 20s, stands firm at their side.

> **Aldric Ruviero:** > _“Today is not just our family’s victory… it is Valdoro’s victory. This city will be a safe home for all.”_

The camera lingers on **Adrik**, smiling calmly but with secrets in his eyes. Then shifts to **Diego**, whose sharp gaze hides beneath a charming face.

### Hidden Tutorial (Diego)

**Transition:** On-screen text – _“That same night”_.
Player immediately takes control of **Diego Ruviero**.

- **Objective:** _“Eliminate the family traitor.”_
- **Gameplay Tutorial:**

  - Stealth → tailing a target through a dark alley.
  - Basic combat → throwing knives, quick strikes.
  - Finisher → QTE execution.

**Arena:** An old warehouse in the harbor district. Dim lights, heavy rain.
After the chase, Diego captures the target → brutal execution cutscene reveals his darker side.

---

### Identity Revealed

Cutscene plays. Diego radios Adrik.

> **Diego:** > _“The traitor is silent. Nothing left behind.”_

> **Adrik (via radio):** > _“Good. Remember, Valdoro can only be protected through shadows. Come home, Diego.”_

The camera shows Diego standing in the rain, his silhouette framed against the city lights.

### Title Card

**Visual:** A large neon-lit logo flashes with thunder:

# 🎮 FAR CRY 0: SHADOW OF VALDORO

_Background:_ Diego stands on the warehouse rooftop, rifle in hand, Valdoro glowing in the distance.

---

### Shift to Alex (Main POV)

Daytime. **Alex** arrives in Valdoro with a modest suitcase. The city bustles: markets, cafés, street music, and friendly locals.

> **Alex (VO Monologue):** > _“Valdoro… the city they say is the safest. A perfect place to forget the past of someone like me.”_

**Gameplay intro:** Player as Alex, walking through the city → chatting with vendors, seeing Ruviero murals, overhearing citizens praising their rule.

---

### An Unexpected Night

On his way home through a narrow alley, Alex spots a terrified man with a **metal gag** over his mouth. Instinctively, he tries to intervene.

From the shadows, **Diego emerges**.

- Alex: _“Hey! What are you doing?!”_
- Diego (coldly, without looking back): _“Not your concern, stranger.”_

Gameplay: Alex attempts to stop him but is easily overpowered. Diego executes the target right before Alex’s eyes.

Before leaving, Diego whispers:

> **Diego:** > _“Valdoro is no place for heroes. You’ll learn that soon enough.”_

Alex collapses, stunned.

---

### Alex’s First Doubt

The next day, Alex remains shaken. The city’s safety is nothing but an illusion.

> **Alex (VO):** > _“I only wanted peace. But last night opened my eyes… Valdoro isn’t paradise. It’s a wolf’s den.”_

**New Objective:** _“Find out who Diego Ruviero is.”_

From here, Alex begins investigating the city, slowly pulled into the Ruviero family’s shadow war.

---

## ⚔️ Beginning of the Arc – The First Hunt

Alex decides to leave Valdoro.
But word spreads that a “stranger” witnessed a secret execution. The **Ruviero family** wants him alive — not dead — but to Alex, that’s no better than losing his freedom.

### Gameplay – _Hunter Becomes the Hunted_

- Player as **Alex**, trying to **escape the city core** toward the outer terminal.

- **Visual contrast:**

  - City center → bright, heavy CCTV, “official” patrols.
  - Outskirts → wild forests, mafia routes, smuggler camps.

- **Gameplay focus: survival & evasion:**

  - Sneaking past checkpoints.
  - Escaping into the forest.
  - Using the wilderness (mud, rivers, ruins) to evade pursuit.

- Occasionally, Alex is forced to fight with improvised weapons (pipes, crafted knives, stolen firearms).

---

## 🩸 Diego “The Prodigy” Hunts

The Ruvieros send **Diego** to hunt Alex.
To the city, Diego is a symbol of the future.
To Alex, he is the predator in the dark.

### Gameplay – The Cross Hunt

- Diego stalks from the outskirts → **sniping from forest towers**, laying traps, ambushes in fishing villages.
- The player feels less like a hunter, more like **the prey**.
- Every time Alex nears escape, Diego blocks the way.

---

## 🎯 Boss Fight – Diego “The Prodigy”

- **Arena:** Rooftop of an abandoned building on the city–forest border. Neon lights of Valdoro shimmer in the stormy distance.
- **Theme:** Clash of two worlds → city’s light vs wilderness’ shadow.
- **Diego’s Combat Style:** aggressive stealth, combining sniper shots & knife rushdowns.
- **Ending:** Alex kills Diego unintentionally, out of pure survival instinct.

> **Diego (final words):** > _“I was just a street kid… they gave me a home, a name, a weapon. If I die now… who’s gonna care?”_

Alex realizes the truth: **Diego was the Ruvieros’ golden child.**

---

## 🌆 After Diego’s Death

- In the city: media brands Alex as the “mysterious killer” who murdered Valdoro’s young hero.
- On the outskirts: mafia clamps down, forests are locked with tighter checkpoints, patrols swarm the exits.
- Alex is trapped — **can’t go back to the city, can’t escape through the wild.**

> **Aldric Ruviero:** > _“He stole our light. Then let Valdoro’s shadows hunt him down.”_

---

# **🌑 End of Arc 1 – Alex’s Turning Point**

### 🎥 Cutscene – “The Prey Becomes a Weapon”

- Diego’s death makes **Alex the city’s most wanted**.

  - Media → “The mysterious killer.”
  - Citizens → divided; some believe Alex is a criminal, others sense hidden truths.

- Alex becomes the **#1 fugitive** of Valdoro.

> **News broadcast at a bar:** > _“Diego Ruviero, the symbol of Valdoro’s future, has been slain by an unidentified stranger. Police vow to capture him dead or alive. The Ruviero family has placed a massive bounty on Alex.”_

---

### 🎭 Enter the Opposition

Alex hides in an **underground bar at the outskirts**, wounded and exhausted. Just as he’s about to give up, **three emissaries** approach one by one:

#### 1. **Rival Mafia**

- Laid-back but threatening.
- They see Alex as a tool for **revenge**.
- _“You’ve opened the door. Let us tear the rest down. All you need is to walk with us.”_

#### 2. **The Old Corrupt Government**

- An elder envoy, in a suit, full of political rhetoric.
- They want Alex as **propaganda** to reclaim lost influence.
- _“The people need truth. You can be the face that inspires them, while we pull the strings.”_

#### 3. **The Idealists (Anti-Mafia)**

- Last to arrive, humble, scarred from past wars.
- They lack resources, but burn with resolve.
- _“We know who Diego really was. We know the family’s secrets. You’re not alone, Alex. With us, you can bring them down.”_

---

### 🎮 Player Choice – The Turning Point
