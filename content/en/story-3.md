# **Path: The Shadow Conspiracy Faction**

---

## 🎭 Overview

The Shadow Conspiracy is a **network of outcasts and defectors**: distant Ruviero relatives cast aside, former enforcers who “knew too much,” and scholars who suspect a dark secret lurks behind Valdoro’s seemingly perfect façade.

They claim to fight for **hidden truths**, but their real goal is to **control the narrative** and seize power once the Ruviero Twins falter.

Their slogan is:

> **“Behind the city’s light, there is always a shadow.”**

To the player, they first appear as allies who “open your eyes.” But gradually, it becomes clear—they only want to **use Alex as a pawn** in their underground political game.
