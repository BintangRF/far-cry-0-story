# **Path: Anti-Mafia Revolutionary Faction**

---

## 🎭 Overview

The Revolutionary Faction was born from **the anger of the common people**: activists, students, workers, families of mafia victims, and even war veterans disappointed with the government and authorities. They call themselves the true voice of the people. Their slogan is:

> **“Better the city burns than live under the mafia.”**

They see the protagonist as a **symbol of the oppressed**, and every player action is turned into propaganda. However, the player gradually realizes that this revolution is not just for the people—it’s also about revenge, power, and an ideology as extreme as the mafia’s tyranny.
