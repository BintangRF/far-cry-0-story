# **Path: Anti-Mafia Revolutionary Faction**

---

## 🎭 Overview

The Revolutionary Faction was born from **the anger of the common people**: activists, students, laborers, families of mafia victims, even war veterans disappointed with the government and authorities. They call themselves the true voice of the people. Their slogan is:

> **“Better the city burns than live under the mafia.”**

They see the protagonist as a **symbol of the oppressed**. Every move the player makes becomes propaganda to fuel the masses. But gradually, the player realizes: this revolution isn’t purely for the people—it’s driven by revenge, power, and ideology as harsh as mafia tyranny.

## ⚖️ Consequences After Mini Bosses

After the three mini bosses fall, the Revolutionaries celebrate the player as a **people’s hero**. The player’s face is displayed on city murals, becoming a propaganda icon.

But behind the celebration:

- They grow more radical, forcing citizens to join or be labeled traitors.
- Civilian casualties rise, considered a “price worth paying.”
- They pressure the player to lead a **total revolution** — not just against the Twin Mafia, but also against anyone opposing their ideology.

The player realizes: **this revolution doesn’t bring peace, only a new tyranny fueled by revenge.**
